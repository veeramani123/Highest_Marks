# Highest_Marks
Part 2 
The attached csv file contains the marks scored by students in a class, in different subjects. Each row has the marks scored by the student in the subjects of Maths, Biology, English, Physics, Chemistry, and Hindi. Write a python program, without using pandas, to efficiently 
1. Find the topper in each subject. 
2. Find the top 3 students in the class, based on their marks in all subjects. 
3. The results should be printed on the console upon running the program with the csv file as the argument, and look as below:
Topper in Maths is (name of student) 
Topper in Biology is (name of student) 
... 
Best students in the class are (student first rank, student second rank, student third rank) 
Here, the actual student names should be output. Also state complexity of your algorithm in the Big-O asymptotic notation. 
NOTE: pandas should not be used.
